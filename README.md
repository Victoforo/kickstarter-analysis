# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analyst on Kickstarter Data
## Overview of Project
On this proyect we analyst the crowdfunding data in order to find especific data than can help us to understand better each proyect and whith the insights take better decisions

## Analysis and Challenges
For this analysis, I first classified the data in colors to have a quick analysis, then I began to separate in terms of customer requirements and realizing the most profitable data.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In this analysis it is noted that May and June are the best months for launching campaigns, however, the months with the lowest profits were: January, March, November and December.
So I conclude that the end of Q2 and the beginning of Q3 of the year are the better in relation to outcomes vs launch date
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Plays with a lower goal budget were more successful than those with a larger goal budget, so I would recommend making more plays with a goal of 1000 to 4999 L
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The difficulties are found when changing the subcategory or from country to country, since the data obtained would have to be analyzed separately to obtain a better response
